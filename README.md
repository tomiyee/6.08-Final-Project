# JoeBox Party Games

This repository contains files for our team's 6.08 final project, 
which we call "JoeBox Party Games," named after the awe-inspiring 
paragon of man that is Joe Steinmeyer, our 6.08 professor.

## JoeBox Game 0 - Name TBD

This game will support up to 8 players that can submit a lie and 
try to fool other players. To type their messages, the players
will use their gyroscope, similarly to the Wikipedia UI design 
exercise.

## JoeBox Game 1 - Name TBD

This is a simple Simon-Says style game making use of the two 
buttons on our ESP32.
